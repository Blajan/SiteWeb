                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>My name is Blajan Razvan, I am 23 years old, I am Romanian and I am a person motivated, ambitious and persevering enough 
                    to achieve my goals. I am the person who likes to get out of the comfort zone, because I know that area does not bring any 
                    benefit and I am proud of that because that forces me to evolve. In 5 years, and not only, I will be a very successful person, 
                    working in a big company, doing what I like, sitting with the right people and growing every day.

            <h2 id="disappearH2">These are the skills learned in recent years that I think will help me in my IT career.</h2>

            <div class="boxText" id="team">
                <p>Working in an IT company, the ability to communicate and work in a team are indispensable. 
                    I managed to develop on this side. I think I would be able to integrate quite easily into a new team.
                    I consider myself an altruistic person, who puts the team's goals on their first and personal ones on the secondary.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="boxText" id="continuousDevelopment">
                <p>In the last year I have become familiar with the idea of continuous development. 
                    Currently I make the most of every moment when I can learn something. This skill is my greatest achievement. 
                    It will help me to always be curious, to learn daily and to get out of my comfort zone to reach success.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="boxText" id="communication">
                <p>At the job of programmer and not only, I came into contact with many people and I managed to learn from them a 
                    lot of new things and default the ability to communicate, where I progress daily. When I communicate with a person 
                    I am careful to learn things, words or even new concepts, this forms me and helps me to see things from a different perspective. 
                </p>
            </div>
                
            <div class="boxText" id="solving">
                <p>I like to face problems and strive to solve them, I know that this makes me better and forces me to grow.
                    Problem solving is part of the day-to-day work of a programmer and I believe that everyone in this field should manage on this side.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="boxText" id="learn">
                <p>In the last year I've realized that I love learning and that's what I always want to do, not do things that cap me.
                    Due to the fact that I like to constantly learn, I managed to get acquainted with idea of learning, so it's much easier for me to learn.
